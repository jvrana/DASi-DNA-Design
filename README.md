# DASi DNA Design

**DASi** is an automatic DNA cloning plan designer aimed for operating on small budgets by focusing on material
re-use.

The software converts a nucleotide sequence, or a library of sequences, to an executable molecular assembly plan while 
optimizing material cost, assembly efficiency, and assembly time.

The software goals are reminiscent of j5 or Teselegen but focused on:
1. having a dead-simple user interface and 
1. utilizing information about current laboratory inventory in its optimization algorithm

### Planned Features

* Golden-gate support
* heirarchical assembly
* library support
* front-end
* connection to fabrication facility

### Use cases

* developing cloning plans from computer-generated sequences
* developing cloning plans for human-generated sequences for lazy folks (like me; no judgements)
* developing plans for users that do not know the intricacies of molecular biology
