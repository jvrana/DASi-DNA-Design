# Shoestring DNA

**Shoestring** is an automatic DNA cloning plan designer aimed for operating on small (shoestring!) budgets.

**Shoestring** provides a DNA sequence to workflow interpreter, utilizing knowledge of existing primers, PCR fragments,
and templates to produce an efficient and cost-effective cloning plan.

### Use cases

* developing cloning plans from computer-generated sequences
* developing cloning plans for human-generated sequences for lazy folks (like me; no judgements)
