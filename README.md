# Shoestring DNA

**Shoestring** is an automatic DNA cloning plan designer aimed for operating on small budgets.

### Features

**Shoestring** provides a DNA sequence to workflow interpreter, utilizing knowledge of existing primers, PCR fragments,
and templates to produce an efficient and cost-effective cloning plan. Currently, it only supports homology assembly
(such as *gibson assembly*)

### Planned Features

* Golden-gate support
* heirarchical assembly
* library support

### Use cases

* developing cloning plans from computer-generated sequences
* developing cloning plans for human-generated sequences for lazy folks (like me; no judgements)
* developing plans for users that do not know the intricacies of molecular biology
