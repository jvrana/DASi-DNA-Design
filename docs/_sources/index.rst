DASi is an automatic DNA cloning plan designer aimed for operating on small budgets
by focusing on material re-use.

The software converts a nucleotide sequence, or a library of sequences,
to an executable molecular assembly plan while optimizing material cost,
assembly efficiency, and assembly time.
